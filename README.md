This Repository contains C implementation of various algorithms parallellized for computing using OpenMP. The Repo covers many concepts of OpenMP using C from using clauses and constructs in OpenMP to parallelize algorithms. The parallelized implementations in this repo range from operations on arrays, matrices, sorting algorithms to mathematical constants estimations.

## Instructions to Run

* #### OpenMP  
  * `cd` into code directory
  * Run `gcc -fopenmp filename.c -o exec` to create executable
  * Run `exec`to execute
  
* #### Open MPI  
  * `cd` into code directory
  * Run `mpicc filename.c -o exec` to create executable
  * Run `mpirun -np t ./exec`to execute (t -> number of threads)
